# Random Graion Tweaks

This mod features various tweaks by Graion Dilach for games on the Infinity Engine.

## Components 10-23 More Random Spell Scrolls (EE games only)

Inspired by SCS's "Wider spell scrolls" component, these components add random arcane spell scrolls the arcane/divine spellcasters. The random spell scrolls include mod-added scrolls _if they follow the spell.ids standard_ (scrolls of spells added through the OlvynChuru UI hack are not included).

The following combinations are offered (each can be selected individiually):
 - __10:__ one arcane scroll on the level of the highest arcane level memorized
 - __11:__ one arcane scroll up to the level of the highest arcane level memorized
 - __12:__ one arcane scroll on the level above 4 of the highest arcane level memorized (so if it's a level 5 spell, the scroll will be level 1, level 6 will receive level 2 scroll etc.)
 - __13:__ one arcane scroll up to the level above 4 of the highest arcane level memorized (so if it's a level 5 spell, the scroll will be level 1, level 6 will receive up to level 2 scroll etc.)
 - __20:__ one arcane scroll on the level of the highest divine level memorized
 - __21:__ one arcane scroll up to the level of the highest divine level memorized
 - __22:__ one arcane scroll on the level above 4 of the highest divine level memorized (so if it's a level 5 spell, the scroll will be level 1, level 6 will receive level 2 scroll etc.)
 - __23:__ one arcane scroll up to the level above 4 of the highest divine level memorized (so if it's a level 5 spell, the scroll will be level 1, level 6 will receive up to level 2 scroll etc.)

This means that a high-level Cleric-Mage can end up with up to 8 additional scrolls if all components are installed.

__COMPATIBILITY:__ These components should be installed after all mods which might buff spellcaster AI (SCS). These components functionally overlap with SCS's "Wider spell scrolls" but they can be installed together. These components __need__ to be installed after [Abel's Nonrandom Treasures](https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/83483/mod-nonrandom-treasures) mod on IWDEE.

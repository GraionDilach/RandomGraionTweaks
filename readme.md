# Random Graion Tweaks

This mod features various tweaks by Graion Dilach for games on the Infinity Engine.

## Components 10-23 More Random Spell Scrolls

Inspired by SCS's "Wider spell scrolls" component, these components add random arcane spell scrolls the arcane/divine spellcasters. The random spell scrolls include mod-added scrolls _if they follow the spell.ids standard_ (scrolls of spells added through the OlvynChuru UI hack are not included).

The following combinations are offered (each can be selected individiually):
 - 10: one arcane scroll on the level of the highest arcane level memorized
 - 11: one arcane scroll up to the level of the highest arcane level memorized
 - 12: one arcane scroll on the level above 4 of the highest arcane level memorized (so if it's a level 5 spell, the scroll will be level 1, level 6 will receive level 2 scroll etc.)
 - 13: one arcane scroll up to the level above 4 of the highest arcane level memorized (so if it's a level 5 spell, the scroll will be level 1, level 6 will receive up to level 2 scroll etc.)
 - 20: one arcane scroll on the level of the highest divine level memorized
 - 21: one arcane scroll up to the level of the highest divine level memorized
 - 22: one arcane scroll on the level above 4 of the highest divine level memorized (so if it's a level 5 spell, the scroll will be level 1, level 6 will receive level 2 scroll etc.)
 - 23: one arcane scroll up to the level above 4 of the highest divine level memorized (so if it's a level 5 spell, the scroll will be level 1, level 6 will receive up to level 2 scroll etc.)

This means that a high-level Cleric-Mage can end up with up to 8 additional scrolls if all components are installed.

__COMPATIBILITY:__ These components should be installed after all mods which might buff spellcaster AI (SCS). These components __need__ to be installed after [Abel's Nonrandom Treasures](https://forums.beamdog.com/discussion/83483/mod-nonrandom-treasures) mod on IWDEE.
